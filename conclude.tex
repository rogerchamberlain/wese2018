\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclude}

We have described a first-year course that we feel is appropriate
for both computer science and computer engineering majors. For example,
we believe it is helping students discover
that they want to be computer engineers when they come into the course
not really knowing what computer engineering is.

With the proliferation of
computing well beyond the desktop and the server room, the sheer numbers
of computers that interact with the physical world are growing and
will continue to grow.
We believe that an early introduction to the core concepts
introduced in this course is well deserved.
