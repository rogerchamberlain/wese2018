\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclude}

% NOTE: BSIEVER: I tightened this up a bit. 

We have described a first-year course that provides foundational material common to  both computer science and computer engineering majors. We believe it is helping students without discover an interest in computer engineering despite prior exposure to computer engineering.  Moreover, we belive if provides an introduction to the prevasiveness and breadth of computing early in the curriculum.
