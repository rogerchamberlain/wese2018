\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclude}

% NOTE: BSIEVER: I tightened this up a bit. 

We have described a first-year course that provides foundational material
common to  both computer science and computer engineering majors.
We believe it is helping students discover an interest in computer
engineering despite limited prior exposure to the field.
Moreover, we believe it provides an introduction to the pervasiveness and
breadth of computing early in the curriculum.
