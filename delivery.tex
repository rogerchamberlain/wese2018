\subsection{Active Learning}

For the last decade, the department has had a stong commitment to
active learning~\cite{scbggg10,sgcggt10}.
The evidence for the benefits of active learning is
extensive~\cite{jjs98,lst99,Prince04,rss97},
and while actively learning is applied broadly, it is particularly
compelling in science, math, and engineering
design~\cite{Freeman14,lst99,Hake98,Byerley01,kb06}, including computer
science~\cite{McConnell96,tlb01,skltc10,ag13}
and cyber-physical systems~\cite{me14,mmy16}.

Active learning is often associated with a \emph{flipped} classroom, in
which students work on problems during the time that would otherwise be
relegated to lecture.  A significant problem with the flipped classroom is
that students make progress on a posed problems at different
rates.
The active learning approach we use at Washington University across the entire
first year is \emph{studio}-based~\cite{hnc08}.
Our studio sessions evolved from observation of our colleagues in
Art and Architecture as they work with their students.  As elaborated below,
elements present in
these sessions include collaboration, continual feedback about product
and process, groups comprised of of 2-4 students who work at a similar rate, 
and a problem to be solved by that group that lacks a unique
answer or approach.  The sessions are guided but unscripted, with the
students in a given group progressing at their own pace.

Collaboration is important to our students' studies for the following reasons.
Studies~\cite{Krause:2012:EFL:2157136.2157192} have shown that women are
attracted in greater numbers to the study of computer science when they
appreciate the extent to which it is practiced collaboratively.  Because
the practice of computer science is largely collaborative, featuring collaboration
in our early courses provides a more accurate impression of computer science
practice to all of our students.  We therefore have intentionally collaborative
sessions that allow our students to enjoy learning by interacting with others
and to develop the skills that are useful for working in groups.

Continual feedback during studio sessions is important to keep groups on
track and to reinforce that the material they are learning is important to
their studies.  For our courses, the feedback and guidance is provided by
a teaching assistant (TA) assigned to each group and by faculty who 
roam between the groups.  The TA is close in age to the students in the
course, typically one or two years further in computer science studies.
Studies have shown that novices are more likely to predict the difficulty
of a task for other novices than are experts~\cite{Hinds:1999}.  Moreover,
the TA is more likely to empathize with the difficulty of a task than is
an expert, and students appreciate the guidance of our TAs as well as their
empathy with the difficutly of studies in computer science.

The studio groups are arranged by the students themselves, often determined
by the way students seat themselves in the room. In our experience, a group
functions best when its members are closest in ability, knowledge, and
experience.

\subsection{Student Assessment}

The assessment of students takes a number of forms, including studio
participation, on-line quizzes, assignments, and exams.
For an individual module on a typical week,
students are expected to watch the videos
and do any required reading prior to the studio session for that module.
A pre-studio quiz (completed on-line) is used to incentivize this
requirement.  For a Monday studio, the first quiz is due Sunday night.
These quiz questions are designed to be straightforward to answer if
they have done what was asked of them (e.g., repetition of facts,
very simple analysis).

Studio itself is not graded based on correct answers to any questions, but
rather participation. The assignment for that module is started on the
following laboratory session (on Wednesday following a Monday studio)
and is due during the laborabory session one week later.

The second quiz is due Wednesday evening, the same day that the assignment
is due. It is also on-line, and for this quiz the questions are designed
to be similar in content, scope, and style as those that they are likely to
experience on the exams. 

At three points during the semester (approximately evenly spaced) there
is a written exam.  During each of those weeks, the
studio session is tailored to have review content, the second laboratory
meeting during the week does not have an assignment due, and the
exam is scheduled in the evening (so that all students are taking the
exam simultaneously).
In some semesters, the last exam has been comprehensive.  For the most
recent semesters, it has been restricted to the last third of the material.
