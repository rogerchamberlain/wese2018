\subsection{Active Learning}

For the last decade, the department has had a stong commitment to
active learning~\cite{scbggg10,sgcggt10}.
The evidence for the benefits of active learning is
extensive~\cite{jjs98,lst99,Prince04,rss97},
and while actively learning is applied broadly, it is particularly
compelling in science, math, and engineering
design~\cite{Freeman14,lst99,Hake98,Byerley01,kb06}, including computer
science~\cite{McConnell96,tlb01,skltc10,ag13}
and cyber-physical systems~\cite{me14,mmy16}.

The active learning approach we use at Washington University across the entire
first year is studio-based~\cite{hnc08}.
