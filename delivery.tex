\section{Instructional Delivery and Materials}
\label{sec:delivery}

\subsection{Contact Time}

The class follows the \emph{flipped classroom} paradigm.  The course is lecture-free, with students meeting twice a week in the instructional laboratories.   One of the weekly meetings is an active learning \emph{studio session}.  The other meeting serves multiple needs: it is used for live-grading and in-person feedback on assignments, it's often used as a convenient meeting time for any group work, and it is also a time when all students should be able to meet with instructional staff for additional assistance with concepts or assignments.

For the last decade, the department has had a strong commitment to active learning~\cite{scbggg10,sgcggt10}. The evidence for the benefits of active learning is extensive~\cite{jjs98,lst99,Prince04,rss97}, and while actively learning is applied broadly, it is particularly compelling in science, math, and engineering design~\cite{Freeman14,lst99,Hake98,Byerley01,kb06}, including computer science~\cite{McConnell96,tlb01,skltc10,ag13}, computer engineering~\cite{hmdpa04,sr02}, and cyber-physical systems~\cite{me14,mmy16}.

Active learning is often associated with a flipped classroom.  In a flipped classroom a significant amount of non-contact time is devoted to the content typically delivered via lecture, i.e., introducing conceptual material through either required readings or pre-recorded lecture videos.  Contact time is spent \emph{actively} engagin with the course content, typically via applied problem solving or structured discussions.

A significant problem with the flipped classroom is that students make progress on posed problems at different rates. The active learning approach we use at Washington University across the entire first year is \emph{studio}-based~\cite{hnc08}. Our studio sessions evolved from observation of our colleagues in Art and Architecture as they work with their students.  As elaborated below, elements present in these sessions include collaboration, continual feedback about product and process, groups comprised of of 2-4 students who work at a similar rate, and a problem to be solved by that group that lacks a unique answer or approach.  The sessions are guided but unscripted, with the students in a given group progressing at their own pace.

Collaboration is important to our students' studies for the following reasons.
Studies~\cite{Krause:2012:EFL:2157136.2157192} have shown that women are
attracted in greater numbers to the study of computer science when they
appreciate the extent to which it is practiced collaboratively.  Because
the practice of computer science is largely collaborative, featuring collaboration
in our early courses provides a more accurate impression of computer science
practice to all of our students.  We therefore have intentionally collaborative
sessions that allow our students to enjoy learning by interacting with others
and to develop the skills that are useful for working in groups.

Continual feedback during studio sessions is important to keep groups on
track and to reinforce that the material they are learning is important to
their studies.  For our courses, the feedback and guidance is provided by
a teaching assistant (TA) assigned to each group and by faculty who
roam between the groups.  The TA is close in age to the students in the
course, typically one or two years further in computer science studies.
Studies have shown that novices are more likely to predict the difficulty
of a task for other novices than are experts~\cite{Hinds:1999}.  Moreover,
the TA is more likely to empathize with the difficulty of a task than is
an expert, and students appreciate the guidance of our TAs as well as their
empathy with the difficulty of studies in computer science.

This approach allows instructional personnel to immediately answer the questions that may arise when students try to apply concepts, but which seldom are presented during a live lecture.  

The studio groups are arranged by the students themselves, often determined
by the way students seat themselves in the room. In our experience, a group
functions best when its members are closest in ability, knowledge, and
experience.  An opposite approach would form a team with some students who
are capable enough to help the other students in the team.  We have found
that resentment develops by all members in such situations, so we hope for
teams with students at the same level.   We do not take steps directly to
form such teams.  Instead, we encourage students to move between teams in
the first few sessions, and they usually settle in a team that is comfortable
for them.  Another important aspect of team work in studio is that we neither
insist upon nor do we expect that teams should reach the end of all the work
we assign in studio.  The idea is to plow deep, not far, and we grade
students' studio sessions on participation,
not on reaching any particular point in the
studio work.  We encourage students to complete the studio work they did not
finish in the 90-minute studio session outside our watch,
on their own or with team members,
as they prefer.

Finally, the types of problems we pose in studio session are purposefully
amenable to multiple solutions and approaches.  Examples from the
first semester course include designing
a flag and anthem for a fictitious country, determining how to draw a Sierpinski
triangle, and throwing darts randomly at a dartboard to compute an approximation
of $\pi$.
Examples from this course include peak detection (counting steps in
accelerometer data) and finite-state machine design for parsing
incoming messages from another processor.
Students know there is more than one way to solve any of these
problems, which liberates them from finding the \emph{right} way and
empowers them to find their \emph{own} way.  This lack of structure can make
the sessions challenging for our TAs, but they enjoy watching students work
together to create solutions in studio.












The execution platforms we use are built around the Arduino Uno~\cite{arduino},
which has an 8-bit AVR microcontroller as the processor,
and a traditional desktop (or laptop) machine that the
students program using Java (with the Eclipse IDE~\cite{eclipse}).
There are two specific advantages to using the Arduino platform.
First, it has a huge following in the maker/hobbyist community, which
is highly motivational for the students.  We regularly point them to
follow-on opportunities for extra-curricular projects.
Second, the simple 8-bit microcontroller at its core is conducive to
learning basic computer architecture and machine/assembly language
(which we include in the course as an additional core computer
science and engineering concept worthy of exposure in the first year).

There is an advantage to using Java with Eclipse as well. That is the
development environment the students use in the first semester course, so
it is familiar to them already as they enter.  This decreases the chance
of cognitive overload on purely logistical subjects, the Eclipse environment
is familiar, the Arduino development environment is very simple, the
Java language is familiar, and the Arduino C subset is quite close to
Java syntactically.

While there are a plethora of texts available within the Arduino
ecosystem, they are primarily targeting (and therefore better suited for)
the hobbyist community. Since
our course is intended to focus on core concepts, using the
Arduino platform for illustration and experimentation, we have authored
a text~\cite{cc17} for use with the course (which has the obvious
advantage of being well matched to the course goals).

\subsection{Student Assessment}

The assessment of students takes a number of forms, including studio
participation, on-line quizzes, assignments, and exams.
For an individual module on a typical week,
students are expected to watch the videos
and do any required reading prior to the studio session for that module.
A pre-studio quiz (completed on-line) is used to incentivize this
requirement.  For a Monday studio, the first quiz is due Sunday night.
These quiz questions are designed to be straightforward to answer if
they have done what was asked of them (e.g., repetition of facts,
very simple analysis).

Studio itself is not graded based on correct answers to any questions, but
rather participation. The assignment for that module is started on the
following laboratory session (on Wednesday following a Monday studio)
and is due during the laboratory session one week later.

Students are provided with a rubric along with the assignment instructions,
so they know exactly how their work will be graded. These rubrics often evaluate
not just the functionality of a submission (does it work?) but also the approach
that students use (did they choose an appropriate implementation?). Our TAs are then
provided with the same rubric which they use to assess student's work. When
students are ready to submit their assignments, they must show their work
to a TA who will complete the rubric and submit the grade for that assignment.

The second quiz is due Wednesday evening, the same day that the assignment
is due. It is also on-line, and for this quiz the questions are designed
to be similar in content, scope, and style as those that they are likely to
experience on the exams.

At three points during the semester (approximately evenly spaced) there
is a written exam.  During each of those weeks, the
studio session is tailored to have review content, the second laboratory
meeting during the week does not have an assignment due, and the
exam is scheduled in the evening (so that all students are taking the
exam simultaneously).
In some semesters, the last exam has been comprehensive.  For the most
recent semesters, it has been restricted to the last third of the material.
