``More structure and organization, use more difficult examples when
teaching the material since the assignments were a lot harder than
the given examples.''

``It needs more organization.'' We didn't do as good a job as we should have
in communicating due dates, etc. A number of the specifics on the calendar
were filled out (made available to the students) as the semester proceeded.
In retrospect, this was a mistake, as a number of things didn't make it on
to the calendar early enough for everyone to see them.
