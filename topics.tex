\section{Intellectual Topics}
\label{sec:topics}

While the course is aimed at first-year students, it is not intended
to be a survey course that merely introduces students to a number of
topics, without expecting them to master any of them.
While true mastery of topics might seem out of scope for
any first-year course, this course definitely is intended to go
beyond simple introduction to at least some level of fluency.

In the paragraphs that follow, we will describe what intellectual
topics we cover in the course, and also articulate the level
of understanding we aim for the students to achieve.
