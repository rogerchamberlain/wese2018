\section{Intellectual Topics}
\label{sec:topics}

The course provides both exposure to and mastery of a variety of concepts
in embedded systems and CPS, which are also significant components
of the ACM/IEEE
Computer Science~\cite{cs13} and Computer Engineering~\cite{ce16} curricula.
Below we list what intellectual topics we cover in the course.
Items marked with an astrisk ($^*$)
indicate topics that students are expected to gain significant mastery
while non-marked items indicate concepts with lesser depth.
